# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects credit card fraud using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost. An interactive Streamlit app allows real-time fraud prediction.
